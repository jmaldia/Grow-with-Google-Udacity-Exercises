 * Programming Quiz - Navigating the Food Chain (3-8)
 *
 * Use a series of ternary operator to set the category to one of the following:
 *   - "herbivore" if an animal eats plants
 *   - "carnivore" if an animal eats animals
 *   - "omnivore" if an animal eats plants and animals
 *   - undefined if an animal doesn't eat plants or animals
 *
 * Notes
 *   - use the variables `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` in your ternary expressions
 *   - `if` statements aren't allowed ;-)

// change the values of `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` to test your code
var eatsPlants = false;
var eatsAnimals = true;

var category = eatsPlants ? (eatsAnimals ? "omnivore" : "herbivore") : (eatsAnimals ? "carnivore" : undefined);

console.log(category);

var adult = true;
var preorder = true;
console.log("It costs $" + (adult ? "40.00" : "20.00") + " to attend the concert. Pick up your tickets at the " + (preorder ? "will call" : "the gate") + ".");
